      <p>
        My name is <span>Isaac Rutledge</span> I'm a solo developer trying to
        just make a living I'm here because I need to supply for my family. I've
        had a lot of business ideas, and every single one of them has failed. So
        I'm here now. Just trying to bring some bread to the table. I'm here to
        do everything I can to make your internet dreams come true. I'm working
        on developing some more skills, and I'm going to be making mobile
        applications and such soon. So I ask you, if you're interested in owning
        your own website, I will include the source code, and I will deploy the
        site for you if you wish. But any revisions you need done will cost a
        small amount.
      </p>
